## 2026-03-19 18:30 — Deferred plan building & aggressive constant folding

Engine now defers plan building until first `run()` when input shapes are
incomplete. Uses actual input tensor values for aggressive constant folding,
eliminating entire shape-computation chains at build time.

- `InferenceEngine` stores the graph separately from the plan
- Plan rebuilds automatically when input shapes change
- `Plan::build_full` accepts `input_values` for build-time folding
- Loop ops fold when all inputs are known (arange grid generation)
- Int64 binary ops (Add, Sub, Mul, Div) now handled in constant folding
- tiny-yolov3-11: 96 nodes folded (was 30), 183 → 96 fewer plan ops
- All 18 tests pass

## 2026-03-19 17:45 — XNNPACK support for more op types

Added XNNPACK subgraph support for: Transpose, Identity, Unsqueeze, Squeeze,
Slice, Resize, Round, Cast (float→float), ReduceMin.

- Transpose → `xnn_define_static_transpose`
- Identity → `xnn_define_copy`
- Unsqueeze/Squeeze → `xnn_define_static_reshape`
- Slice → `xnn_define_static_slice`
- Resize → `xnn_define_static_resize_bilinear_2d`
- Round → `xnn_define_bankers_rounding`
- Cast (float) → `xnn_define_convert`
- ReduceMin → `xnn_define_static_reduce` with `xnn_reduce_min`

Also expanded constant-folding to cover: Transpose, Neg, Mul, Div, Add, Sub,
Floor, Ceil, Round, Tile, Exp, ReduceMin/Max/Sum, Equal, Less, Greater, Where,
Range, Expand, Min, Max.

## 2026-03-19 16:45 — XNNPACK quantized op support

Added XNNPACK subgraph support for quantized (int8) ONNX operators:
QuantizeLinear, DequantizeLinear, QLinearConv, QLinearMatMul, QLinearAdd.

- Uses XNNPACK's native quantized tensor API (`xnn_define_quantized_tensor_value`,
  `xnn_define_channelwise_quantized_tensor_value`) with automatic ONNX uint8→qint8
  conversion
- Same XNNPACK operators (conv2d, fully_connected, binary) auto-dispatch to
  quantized kernels based on tensor datatype
- `xnn_define_convert` handles QuantizeLinear (fp32→qint8) and DequantizeLinear
  (qint8→fp32)
- Quantization info propagates through layout-preserving ops (MaxPool, Reshape,
  Flatten, GlobalAvgPool, unary ops)
- mnist-12-int8 now 100% XNNPACK-eligible (was 27%)

## 2026-03-19 15:30 — Constant-folding eliminates plan nodes

Ops whose outputs are fully determined at plan-build time (Constant, Shape,
Gather on constants, etc.) are no longer added to the execution plan. Their
computed values go directly into initializers, available at runtime without
redundant execution. This removes the nodes that previously broke XNNPACK
subgraph runs.

Key impact:
- mobilenetv2-12: 100% XNNPACK-eligible (Constant nodes for Clip min/max no longer break runs)
- mnist-1: 12 constant nodes folded away
- yolov4-11: 28 constant nodes folded, now 98% eligible
- CPU-path benchmark: ~1-4% speedup (mobilenetv2-12 best at -4.1%)
